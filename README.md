## üß† Sample Use Case

**Scenario:** A startup founder interested in AI, climate tech, and funding rounds sets a personalized watchlist.

1. The FOMO Tracker scrapes posts from `/r/startups`, `/r/MachineLearning`, and Google Trends.
2. A post titled *‚ÄúOpenAI launches GPT-6 for enterprise users‚Äù* spikes in activity.
3. NLP analysis evaluates sentiment, keyword match, and velocity.
4. A high FOMO-score is calculated (based on relevance + trending rate).
5. The system flags the post, adds it to the user‚Äôs dashboard feed, and optionally sends a push notification or email.
6. The founder clicks through to view the full post and shares it with their network‚Äîensuring they stay informed in real-time.
